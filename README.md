# Stateful Wonka

## Idea

Minimal state management using Wonka's flexible streams.

- When using with ReasonML, you can use ADT's and pattern matching to ensure you are exhuastively handing all possible actions.
- When using with TypeScript, you can still gain strong type-safety by using enum properties on an object instead.
